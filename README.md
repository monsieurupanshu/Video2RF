# Video2RF
Blend of Generative AI and Deep Learning for Human Activity Recognition!

This repository contains the Video2RF project, an innovative venture combining signal processing and machine learning. The project focuses on converting video data into simulated RADAR signals and enhancing these signals using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Human Activity Recognition (HAR).
 
GAN Implementation: For refining simulated RADAR signals.
HAR System: Utilizing CNN for activity recognition with enhanced RADAR signals.
